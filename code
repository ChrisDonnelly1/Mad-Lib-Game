# any tips on how i can tidy things up or add anything for a bit of falre?
# only issue I came across when coding this was when a asking was input on 2 same lines of code ,i.e like lines 1 + 2. both are asking user to input adjectives but, 
# without me putting adjective1, how would the code know to input the second line instead of the first if you know what a mean. Is there a way to fix this so the user doesent see adjective1 etc?
